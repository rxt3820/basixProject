                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvrqmq9A3tA
                We can have this as a checklabel st for the user and they will be able to check off each step they completed.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <label>Unix/label nux is already accessible to Mac users by using the terminal.<ul>
                        <label>You can find the terminal by going to your utilabel ties folder then selecting the terminal. <ul>
                                <label>When you open your terminal you will first see the last login on your account as well as the prompt which ends in a dollar sign($).</label>
                                <label>Now you are all set up to use label nux and practice some commands that you will see soon.</label>
                            </ul>
                        </label>
                    </ul>
                </label>
                <label>Unix/label nux is a bit harder to set up on windows but try following these steps or watch the video that is label nked below
                </label>

                        <ul>
                            <label>Later versions of windows have this button somewhere else so do a quick settings search for “for developers”</label>
                        </ul>
                    </label>
