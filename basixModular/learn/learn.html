                Unix/Linux is already accessible to Mac users by using the terminal.
                You can find the terminal by going to your utilities folder then selecting the terminal. When you open your terminal you will first see the last login on your account as well as the prompt which ends in a dollar sign($).

        <h1> Intro to Commands </h1>
        <div class="boxes">
            <p>
                A command is an order provided by a user asking a machine to do something, such as running a single program or a series of related programs. Commands are usually triggered by accessing them on the command line (i.e. the all-text screen mode) and then hitting the enter key, which sends them to the container. You can access the command line by opening the terminal application you downloaded previously.
            </p>

            <br>
            <dl>
                <dt>PWD</dt>
                <dd> Pwd stands for the Print Working Directory. It prints the route of the working directory, beginning with the root file.</dd>

                <br>

                <dt>cd</dt>
                <dd>The cd command in Linux is known as the change directory command. It is used to modify the current working directory.</dd>

                <br>

                <dt>cd/</dt>
                <dd>This command is used to change the working directory to the root directory. The root directory is the first directory in the hierarchy of your filesystem.</dd>

                <dt>Options For Different Commands</dt>
                <dd>Options modify the way in which a command works. Options are often single letters prefixed with a dash (-) and set off by any number of spaces or tabs. Multiple options in one command line can be set off individually (like -a -b), or, in some cases, you can combine them after a single dash (like -ab).</dd>

                <dt>ls</dt>
